I am pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science** at [**New York University**](https://www.nyu.edu) (GPA 4.0/4.0), where I was honored as an **M. Michael Waller Graduate Award** recipient for outstanding academic performance at [**Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences**](https://cs.nyu.edu).  
Before that, I completed my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** from [**Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India**](https://www.jiit.ac.in) (GPA 9.2, First Division).

I‚Äôve taken professional experiences such as [**CAHOOT.AI**](https://www.cahoot.ai), [**NYU Langone Health**](https://nyulangone.org), [**AXA XL**](https://axaxl.com), [**IIT Madras (AMTDC)**](https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/institute-research-centres/advanced-manufacturing-technology-development-centre), [**MITACS Globalink Research**](https://www.mitacs.ca/en), and [**Takshila Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/takshilalearn/?originalSubdomain=in) to encapsulate my influential strides in technology and research. I‚Äôve pursued research, and my scholastic contributions are evidenced through multiple publications, including [**IEEE Transactions**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10115314/).

I specialize in **Generative AI**, **multi-agentic systems**, and **LLM-based pipelines**, applying techniques such as **prompt engineering**, **in-context learning**, **LoRA fine-tuning**, and **quantization-aware training**. I‚Äôve optimized and deployed models using **parallel computing**, **OpenMP**, and **GPU acceleration** with **CUDA** and **TensorRT**, and built scalable, production-grade systems using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Infrastructure-as-Code tools** like **Terraform** and **CloudFormation** on **AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3)**.

I am an enthusiastic team player with excellent communication skills and a passion for data-driven problem-solving.  
I have always been inquisitive by nature, and it has helped me immensely in every walk of life. It fuels my creativity and makes me want to explore my environment to the fullest.

üé∂ I sing sometimes and üèè follow cricket as a sport.
