Hello! I am Rahul Singhal, pursuing a Masters of Science in Computer Science at New York University (GPA 4.0/4.0). Before that, I did my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India (GPA 9.2, First Division). My zeal for technology transcends academia, penetrating the realms of teaching, professional endeavors, and leading-edge research.

I've taken professional experiences such as NYU Langone Health, AXA XL, AMTDC, MITACS, AMTDC - IIT Madras, and Takshila Learning to encapsulate my influential strides in technology and research. I've pursued research and my scholastic contributions are evidenced through multiple publications incl. IEEE Transactions.

I have strong skills in Python, SQL, R, C++, JavaScript, and many other programming languages. I am proficient in various software tools such as Jupyter, Apache, and PySpark and have hands-on experience with libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I have deployed production systems using Kubernetes, Docker, and Git and have experience with cloud platforms like AWS EC2 and S3. I also have strong skills in data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling, using tools such as Tableau, Matplotlib, and Statsmodel.

I am an enthusiastic team player with excellent communication skills and a passion for data-driven problem-solving. I have always been inquisitive by nature and it has helped me immensely in every walk of life. It fuels my creativity and makes me want to explore my environment to the fullest. I sing sometimes as well and follow cricket as a sport.
