I am pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science** at [**New York University**](https://www.nyu.edu) (GPA 4.0/4.0), where I was honored as an **M. Michael Waller Graduate Award** recipient for outstanding academic performance at [**Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences**](https://cs.nyu.edu).  
Before that, I completed my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** from [**Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India**](https://www.jiit.ac.in) (GPA 9.2, First Division).

I’ve taken professional experiences such as [**QUANTIPHI**](https://quantiphi.com/), [**CAHOOT.AI**](https://www.cahoot.ai), [**NYU Langone Health**](https://nyulangone.org), [**AXA XL**](https://axaxl.com), [**IIT Madras (AMTDC)**](https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/institute-research-centres/advanced-manufacturing-technology-development-centre), [**MITACS Globalink Research**](https://www.mitacs.ca/en), and [**Takshila Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/takshilalearn/?originalSubdomain=in) to encapsulate my influential strides in technology and research. I’ve pursued research, and my scholastic contributions are evidenced through multiple publications, including [**IEEE Transactions**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10115314/).

I specialize in **Generative AI**, **multi-agentic systems**, and **LLM-based pipelines**, applying techniques such as **prompt engineering**, **in-context learning**, **LoRA fine-tuning**, and **quantization-aware training**. I’ve optimized and deployed models using **parallel computing**, **OpenMP**, and **GPU acceleration** with **CUDA** and **TensorRT**, and built scalable, production-grade systems using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Infrastructure-as-Code tools** like **Terraform** and **CloudFormation** on **AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3)**.
